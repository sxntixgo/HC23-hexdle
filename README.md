These are my challenges in the category "HEXDLE" for SAINCON's HC 2023. 

# Running Local

To run the applications locally, make a copy one of the config env files (i.e. `.env-tuesday1`) and name it `.env`, and run the following command to star the docker images:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
```

Finally, access the web application at `127.0.0.1:8000`
